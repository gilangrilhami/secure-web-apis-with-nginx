# secure-web-apis-with-nginx
This project demonstrates how to set up two web APIs (Django Ninja and FastAPI) running in Docker containers, and securely expose them over HTTPS using Nginx as a reverse proxy. The project includes steps for configuring subdomains, obtaining SSL certificates with Certbot, and routing traffic to the appropriate services.
